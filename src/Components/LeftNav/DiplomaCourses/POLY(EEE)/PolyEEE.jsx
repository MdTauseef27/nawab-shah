      <h5>Diploma In Electrical & Electronic Engineering</h5>
      <p>
        The college offers Polytechnic (Electrical & Electronic Engineering)
        course whose details are given below:
      </p>
      <h4>AN INTRODUCTION TO ELECTRICAL & ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING</h4>
      <p>
        If the idea of designing or modifying machines and systems used in
        various manufacturing and service industries appeals to you, then this
        course might just be for you. Electricity has become the basic need for
        survival, globally. From household to industrial plants, communication
        and satellites, electrical equipment, computers etc., all require
        electricity. Thus EEE deals with study and application of electrical
        systems for use in these different environments. It equips you with the
        knowledge of transmission and generation of electrical power, electrical
        circuit design, electronics, instrumentation, control system,
        understanding electrical and electronic networks etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Electrical and electronic engineering is the broadest and most dynamic
        of all engineering. It covers everything from micron-scale transistors
        to macro-scale network systems. The Diploma in Electrical &amp;
        Electronic Engineering will prepare you to be a competent and a much
        sought after technologist to meet the challenges of a very fast-moving
        industry. This qualification provides you with the skills and
        competencies to develop, select, commission, maintain and diagnose
        faults/malfunctions on advanced electrical equipment and systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        We aim to produce competent technologists who will be able to work
        effectively in a wide range of electrical and electronic engineering
        industries. You will be equipped with Design Thinking skills that will
        enable you to conceive new products and services that meet peopleâ€™s
        needs in a technologically feasible and commercially viable way
        providing a good space for higher studies at home and abroad like
        B.Tech. in Electrical &amp; Electronic Engineering.{" "}
