      <h5>PG course being offered by the CIVIL Dept.</h5>
      <p>
        The college offers M. Tech. (Structural Engineering) course whose
        details are given below:
      </p>
      <h4>AN INTRODUCTION TO SE</h4>
      <p>
        M Tech (Structural Engineering) provides thorough knowledge of
        structural engineering, that is, from design stage to construction and
        completion. It is a two-year full time programme. Any BE/B.Tech graduate
        can apply for this postgraduate level programme.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        This course aims at practical and research activities, besides offering
        testing and consultancy services to the community in the area of
        Structural Engineering. Structural engineering deals with analysis as
        well as design of the structures supporting loads. Structural
        engineering is a specialty of civil engineering. It includes features
        like Design and process-modeling, Open-ended problem solving,
        Appropriate technical proficiency in the sub-disciplines of structures
        and materials, The programme has close links with industries and other
        institutions such as the BHEL Ranipet, SERC Chennai, L&amp;T, IIT
        Chennai &amp; Anna University Che.

      <h4>OPPURTUNITIES & PROSPECTS AFTER COMPLETION</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          There are tremendous opportunities for engineers after completion of
          their M. Tech program in Structural Engineering in India as a well as
          abroad.
        </li>
        <li>
          M Tech (Structural Engineering) provides ample job opportunities;
          degree holders can work as structural engineer in any government or
          private organization.
        </li>
        <li>
          A number of software packages related to the field of Structural
          Engineering are available which includes the following.

          Most structural engineers are employed in the construction industry,
          however there are also structural engineers in the aerospace,
          automobile and shipbuilding industries. In the construction industry,
          they work closely with architects, civil engineers, mechanical
          engineers, quantity surveyors, and construction managers.
        </li>
        <li>
          A 2010 survey of professionals occupying jobs in the construction
          industry showed that structural engineers in the UK earn an average
          wage of £35,009. The salary of structural engineers varies from sector
          to sector within the construction industry worldwide, depending on the
          project. For example, structural engineers working in public sector
          projects earn on average £37,083 per annum compared to the £43,947
          average earned by those in commercial projects.
