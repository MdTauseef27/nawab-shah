      <h4>AN INTRODUCTION TO EMBEDED SYSTEM</h4>
      <p>
        An Embedded System is a computer system with a dedicated function within
        a larger mechanical or electrical system, often with real-time computing
        constraints. It is embedded as part of a larger system often including
        hardware and mechanical parts. Embedded systems control many devices in
        common use today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Embedded systems contain processing cores that are either
        microcontrollers or digital signal processors (DSP).
      </p>
      <p>
        A processor is an important unit in the embedded system hardware. It is
        the heart of the embedded system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Embedded systems range from portable devices such as cell phones,
        digital watches and MP3 players, to large stationary installations like
        traffic lights, factory controllers, and largely complex systems like
        hybrid vehicles, MRI, and satellite guidance avionics. Complexity varies
        from low, with a single microcontroller chip, to very high with multiple
        units, peripherals and networks mounted inside a large chassis or
        enclosure.

      <h4>ABOUT PROGRAM</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Our college offers a four-semester M. Tech course in Embedded System
          as per JNTUH syllabus with first two semesters consisting of course
          work, third semester consisting of a comprehensive viva-voce
          examination and the last semester consisting of project work.

      <h4>OPPURTUNITIES & PROSPECTS AFTER COMPLETION</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          There are tremendous opportunities for engineers after completion of
          their M. Tech program in Embedded Systems in India as a well as
          abroad. This can be judged by the current trends in India in the
          fields of Embedded System development.
        </li>
        <li>
          According to recently released NASSCOM report, the total addressable
          embedded system R &amp; D global opportunity is expected to reach
          approx. $89 billion by 2015 where India alone could contribute approx.
          $15 billion in size (by 2015).
        </li>
        <li>
          For engineers holding M. Tech. degree in Embedded Systems, there is
          clear-cut opportunity in the fields of Firmware, System Integration
          &amp; Hardware Designs related to Embedded Systems. However, it must
          be understood that, in this fast-track field, the candidate should
          have a very steep learning curve to cope with current trends.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some of the organizations/companies which are working in the area of
          Embedded System development/applications are Defence Research &amp;
          Development Laboratory (DRDL), Defence Electronics Research Laboratory
          (DLRL), RCI, ANURAG, all located at Hyderabad &amp; all under the
          umbrella of Defence Research &amp; Development Organisation (DRDO)
          having its HQ at New Delhi. Some other prominent &amp; reputed
          Organisations of National/International fame are: Indian space &amp;
          Research Organisation (ISRO) having its establishments located at
          Ahmedabad, Trivandrum, Bangalore &amp; Sriharikota; ECIL, Hyderabad:
          Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Mumbai; National Thermal Power
          Corporation (NTPC), etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          There are many many companies in the private sector working in the
          field of Embedded Systems, having its branches in India as well as
          abroad, viz. Intel, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Texas Instruments,
          Freescale, Philips, HCL Technologies, Wipro, TCS &amp; Samsung etc.{" "}
