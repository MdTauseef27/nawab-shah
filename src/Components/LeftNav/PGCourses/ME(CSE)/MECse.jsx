      <h5>An Introduction To CSE</h5>
      <p>
        Computer Science field has become one of the fastest growing segments of
        our economy which leads to huge demand for computer Engineering
        professionals for the development of faster Hardware components, New
        Communication System &amp; Software. Computer tends to be engineering
        oriented especially when talks about software development and
        maintenance. The program is designed to provide the students with the
        foundation of discipline as well as opportunity for specialization.
      </p>
      <p>
        A separate department for Computer Science and Engineering was formed
        during year 2008 and is striving for the quality of Technical education
        in the field of Computer Science and Engineering since then. The
        department is well equipped with sufficient software and hardware
        facilities. The department has young &amp; dynamic and well-qualified
        &amp; experienced faculties.
      </p>
      <p>
        The department organizes various co-curricular and extra-curricular
        activities to develop important social and professional facilities in
        the student. Most common co-curricular activity is the programming
        contest, which has become regular by this time.
